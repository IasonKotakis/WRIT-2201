# WRIT 2201 - Effective Writing and Research in Information Technology

This course develops fundamental research and technical writing capabilities needed to clearly describe and document IT-related problems and solutions. Students develop these capabilities by working on projects that require research into, and clear descriptions of, technical problems, solutions and procedures using relevant academic and professional genres, and creating an eportfolio to demonstrate and reflect critically on their development as researcher/writers.
