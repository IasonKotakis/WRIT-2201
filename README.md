# iFix it project - Apple Cinema Display

WRIT 2201 - Effective Writing and Research in Information Technology develops fundamental research and technical writing capabilities needed to clearly describe and document IT-related problems and solutions. Students develop these capabilities by working on projects that require research into, and clear descriptions of, technical problems, solutions and procedures using relevant academic and professional genres, and creating an eportfolio to demonstrate and reflect critically on their development as researcher/writers.

During this course I learnt about technical writing capabilities that I had acquire only over through brief overview. This course helped me out to master on how to write technical reports and guides. One of the guides I create was on iFixit on how to replace a Display on an Apple Cinema Display. This guide has managed to help over 400 people to help and repair their Apple Cinema Display.
